## Configuration Commands

The following commands can be used to change FredBoat♪♪'s behaviour.

This includes the bot's response language, auto resume (the bot will start playing music again if a user enters the voice channel) and track announcement (the name of the track will be announced in the channel every time a new track is starting to play).
